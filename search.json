    "text": "Currently, I am deeply interested in research on evolutionary game theory, particularly focusing on statistical and probabilistic approaches to evolutionary games and replicator dynamics. My curiosity lies in understanding how stochastic elements influence the long-term behaviour of evolving populations, including fixation probabilities, stationary distributions, and the impact of noise on equilibrium selection. I am also exploring how different learning dynamics and mutation rates affect evolutionary stability in finite populations, bridging deterministic models with real-world uncertainties. By leveraging tools from probability theory, statistical mechanics, and dynamical systems, I aim to uncover new insights into the emergence of cooperation, evolutionary robustness, and the role of randomness in strategic adaptation. This interdisciplinary approach holds significant potential for applications in biology, economics, and behavioural sciences."
